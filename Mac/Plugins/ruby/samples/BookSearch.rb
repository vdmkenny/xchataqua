# Book channels work by handing you a file. You ask a search bot for a
# subject, it sends back an archive listing what the bots on the channel
# have, and each line of that listing is itself the command that requests
# one item. Reading the archive by hand and pasting a line back is the slow
# part, so this reads it for you and keeps the list to hand.
#
#   /bsearch <terms>   ask the channel's search bots about a subject
#   /blist [filter]    show the last results, optionally matching a word
#   /bget <number>     request one entry from that list
#
# Requesting is left as a separate, numbered step rather than something
# that follows automatically from a search: each file is a deliberate act,
# and whether you may have a given book is a question only you can answer.
